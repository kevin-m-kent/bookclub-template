# FACILITATOR GUIDE

There is no perfect recipe for what makes a bookclub successful and ensuring your group makes it to the finish line, but here's a list of tips from past facilitators who have made it and what worked for them:

 - Come with questions! This can be in the form of working through chapter problems together, or questions you have on the chapter, but opening to questions for the group can sometimes yeild in crickets. This is helpful to create a dialog and also sets a precedent showing your own vulnerability so others _will_ be willing to come with questions, no matter how small
 - Urge presenters to apply the concepts rather than reiterate the chapter. It's nice to have a brief overview but if you learn that someone is working on a package or Shiny app that relates to the package you can gently urge them to present (if they don't want to - that's okay!). 
 - Present bugs! It was really fun working through code problems together as they relate to the chapter and in our own work
